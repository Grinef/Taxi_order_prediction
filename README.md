# Taxi_order_prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the number of taxi orders in the next hour. This project utilizes historical data on taxi orders at airports, provided by the company "Chotenkoye Taxi". Accurate predictions will help attract more drivers during peak demand periods.
